                                    In the area of composites technology we form a close alliance with a leading composite pipe &amp; fittings manufacturer to perform pre-fabrication and on-site installation of the complete piping system.  We have completed piping systems using Glass Reinforced Epoxy (GRE), Glass Reinforced Polyester (GRP) and Glass Reinforced Vinyl Ester (GRV) materials.

                    <p>What makes us stand out is our ability to analyse and decipher an integrated engineering approach to the projects we undertake and turn it into more profitable solutions.</p>

                    <p>Many projects are executed to optimize cost and schedule making use of extensive project management and planning tools coupled with the employment of suitably qualified personnel but very few dwelled into tapping of the local resources, network and content of the project scoping which could result in further project optimisation – THE VALUE ADDED.</p>

                    <p>We have proven to excel in this area by continuously enhancing our know-how in international engineering and contracting service and the excellent local networking pool of resources.  Working alongside with our foreign principals, we were able to transfer significant procurement activities from traditional high cost locations to more cost competitive local resources and this has made them more successful in project acquisitions while we were able to benefit from the shift of works – some may call it transfer of technology while we call it the Value Added Benefit!</p>

                    <p>In the area of steel engineering, we are working with a leading principal for the provision of hydromechanical steel equipment for navigational shipping, barrages and hydropower plants.  In addition, we design &amp; supply complex drive systems for movable bridges.</p>

                    <p>We trade actively in the fields of calibration &amp; specialty gas mixtures, air, gases &amp; liquid filtration products, scaffolding and blasting &amp; painting equipment.</p>
